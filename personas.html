                   who dont use tehnology as much as others , he often uses it for calls , watching movies or acces social media in his free time.

                    or something similar.He thinks that a text-web browser is hard to use and dont 
                    satisfy his needs from a browser , and also time-consuming to learn to use when there are alternatives that requieres only one click 
                    to acces a site.

             a movie name and watch it from his graphical browser in 2 seconds , and also that he can`t watch it from the son`s browser.
             His son tried to show him that is not as hard as it looks to use a text-based browser ,but Leonard dont want to lose his time and will continue to use a graphical Broswer.
